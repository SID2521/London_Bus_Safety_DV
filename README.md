London_Bus_Safety_Data_Visualization 
The London Bus Safety data visualization project covers incidents reported from January 2015 to September 2018. The dashboard presents key insights on bus safety, allowing users to explore incident data by borough, incident type, and route. The primary focus is on borough-wise incident counts, with Westminster, Southwark, and Lambeth having the highest reported incidents. Users can also delve into specific incident types, such as slip-trip-fall onboard injuries, personal injuries, collisions, and assaults. The temporal analysis reveals incident trends over time, showing a gradual decrease from 2015 to 2018. Additionally, the visualization captures seasonal variations, and a TreeMap provides a concise overview of incidents by borough. The project employs a user-friendly interface, enabling stakeholders to interact with and gain insights into the safety aspects of London buses during the specified period.
